# v0.7.0

### Fixes

- Egocentric alignment outputs with incorrect column order  ([Issue #96](https://github.com/EthoML/VAME/issues/96))
- Slow align egocentrical data ([Issue #113](https://github.com/EthoML/VAME/issues/113))
- Standardized config argument across all functions

### Features

- User friendly way to select reference points for alignment ([Issue #89](https://github.com/EthoML/VAME/issues/89))
- Adopt movement Xarray data format ([Issue #111](https://github.com/EthoML/VAME/issues/111))
- Relocate IQR cleaning into preprocessing ([Issue #22](https://github.com/EthoML/VAME/issues/22))
- Created preprocessing module ([Issue #119](https://github.com/EthoML/VAME/issues/119))
- Separate module for visualization of results ([Issue #127](https://github.com/EthoML/VAME/issues/127))
- Further improvements to Pipeline


# v0.6.0
