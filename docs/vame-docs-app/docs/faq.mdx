### Frequently Asked Questions
<details>
  <summary>What is VAME?</summary>
  <p>
    VAME is a framework to cluster behavioral signals obtained from pose-estimation tools. 
    It is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based deep learning framework which leverages the power 
    of recurrent neural networks (RNN) to model sequential data. 
    In order to learn the underlying complex data distribution, we use the RNN in a variational autoencoder 
    setting to extract the latent state of the animal in every step of the input time series.
