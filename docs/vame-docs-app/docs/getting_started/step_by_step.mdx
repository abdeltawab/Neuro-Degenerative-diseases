title: VAME step-by-step
sidebar_position: 2

The VAME workflow consists of four main steps, plus optional steps to analyse your data:
1. Initialize project: This is step is responsible by starting the project, getting your pose estimation data into the right format
2. Preprocess: This step is responsible for cleaning, filtering and aligning the pose estimation data
3. Train neural network:
    - Create a training dataset for the VAME deep learning model.
    - Train a variational autoencoder which is parameterized with recurrent neural network to embed behavioural dynamics.
    - Evaluate the performance of the trained model based on its reconstruction capabilities
4. Segment behavior:
    - Segment pose estimation time series into behavioral motifs, using HMM or K-means.
    - Group similar motifs into communities, using hierarchical clustering.
5. Analysis:
    - Optional: Create motif videos to get insights about the fine grained poses.
    - Optional: Create community videos to get more insights about behaviour on a hierarchical scale.
    - Optional: Visualization and projection of latent vectors onto a 2D plane via UMAP.
    - Optional: Use the generative model (reconstruction decoder) to sample from the learned data distribution, reconstruct random real samples or visualize the cluster centre for validation.
    - Optional: Create a video of an egocentrically aligned animal + path through the community space.


In this tutorial we will show you how to run the VAME workflow using a simple example. The code below can also be found in the `demo.py` script in our Github repository ([link here](https://github.com/EthoML/VAME/blob/main/examples/demo.py)).

You can run an entire VAME workflow with just a few lines, using the [Pipeline method](/docs/getting_started/pipeline).

## 0. [Optional] Download input data
To run VAME you will need a video and a pose estimation file. If you don't have your own data, you download sample data:

```python
from vame.util.sample_data import download_sample_data

source_software = "DeepLabCut"              # "DeepLabCut", "SLEAP" or "LightningPose"
ps = download_sample_data(source_software)  # Data will be downloaded to ~/.movement/data/
videos = [ps["video"]]                      # List of paths to the video files
poses_estimations = [ps["poses"]]           # List of paths to the pose estimation files
```


## 1. Initialize the project
VAME organizes around projects. To start a new project, you need to define a few things:

```python
import vame

working_directory = "."      # The directory where the project will be saved
project = "my-vame-project"  # The name of the project

# [Optional] Customized configuration for the project
config_kwargs = {
    "n_clusters": 15,
    "pose_confidence": 0.9,
    "max_epochs": 100,
}

config_path, config = vame.init_new_project(
    project_name=project_name,
    videos=videos,
    poses_estimations=poses_estimations,
    source_software=source_software,
    working_directory=working_directory,
    config_kwargs=config_kwargs,
)
```

This command will create a project folder in the defined working directory with the project name you defined.
In this folder you can find a config file called [config.yaml](/docs/project-config) which holds the main parameters for the VAME workflow.
The videos and pose estimation files will be linked or copied to the project folder.

## 2. Preprocess the data
The preprocessing step is responsible for cleaning, filtering and aligning the pose estimation data.

```python
vame.preprocessing(
    config=config,
    centered_reference_keypoint=centered_reference_keypoint,
    orientation_reference_keypoint=orientation_reference_keypoint,
)
```

Internally, this function will:

### 2.1 Clean low confidence data points
Pose estimation data points with confidence below the threshold will be cleared and interpolated.

### 2.2 Egocentric alignment
Based on two reference keypoints, the data will be aligned to an egocentric coordinate system:
- `centered_reference_keypoint`: The keypoint that will be centered in the frame.
- `orientation_reference_keypoint`: The keypoint that will be used to determine the rotation of the frame.

By consequence, the `x` and `y` coordinates of the `centered_reference_keypoint` and the `x` coordinate of the `orientation_reference_keypoint` will be set to an array of zeros, and further removed from the dataset.

### 2.3 Clean outliers
Outliers will be removed based on the interquartile range (IQR) method. This means that data points that are below `Q1 - iqr_factor * IQR` or above `Q3 + iqr_factor * IQR` will be cleared and interpolated.

### 2.4 Savitzky-Golay filter
The data will be further smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter.



## 3. Train the neural network
At this point, we will prepare the data for training the VAME model, run the training and evaluate the model.

### 3.1 Create the training dataset
To create the training dataset, which will put the data in the right format for the VAME model, and split it into training and test sets, you can run:

```python
vame.create_trainset(config=config)
```

### 3.2 Training the model
Training the vame model might take a while depending on the size of your dataset and your machine settings. To train the model you can run:

```python
vame.train_model(config=config)
```

### 3.3 Evaluate the model
THe model evaluation produces two plots, one showing the loss of the model during training and the other showing the reconstruction and future prediction of input sequence.

```python
vame.evaluate_model(config=config)
```

## 4. Segment behavior
Behavioral segmentation in VAME is done in two steps: pose segmentation into motifs and community detection.

### 4.1 Pose segmentation
To perform pose segmentation you can run:
```python
vame.segmentat_session(config=config)
```

This will perfomr the segmentation using two different algorithms: HMM and K-means. The results will be saved in the project folder.

### 4.2 Community detection
Community detection is done by grouping similar motifs into communities using hierarchical clustering. To run community detection you can run:

```python
vame.community(
    config=config,
    segmentation_algorithm="hmm",
    cut_tree=2,
)
```

where `segmentation_algorithm` can be either "hmm" or "kmeans" and `cut_tree` is the cut level for the hierarchical clustering.


## 5. Visualize and analyze

### 5.1 Creating motif and community videos
To create motif videos and get insights about the fine grained poses you can run:

```python
vame.motif_videos(
    config=config,
    segmentation_algorithm="hmm",
    video_type=".mp4",
)
```

Create community videos:
```python
vame.community_videos(
    config=config,
    segmentation_algorithm="hmm",
    video_type=".mp4",
)
```

### 5.2 UMAP visualization
To visualize and project latent vectors onto a 2D plane via UMAP you can run:

```python
from vame.visualization.umap import visualize_umap

visualize_umap(
    config=config,
    label="motif",
    segmentation_algorithm="hmm",
)
```

where `label` can be either None, "motif" or "community", and `segmentation_algorithm` can be either 'hmm' or 'kmeans'.
