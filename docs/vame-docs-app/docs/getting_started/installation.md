## Installation

To get started we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with Python 3.11 or higher.


### Install with pip (Recommended)
```python
pip install vame-py
```


### Install from Github repository

1. Clone the VAME repository to your local machine by running
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EthoML/VAME.git
cd VAME
```


2. Installing VAME from local source

**Option 1:** Using VAME.yaml file to create a conda environment and install VAME in it by running
```bash
conda env create -f VAME.yaml
```

**Option 2:**  Installing local VAME with pip in your active virtual environment by running
```bash
pip install .
```

:::warning
You should make sure that you have a GPU powerful enough to train deep learning networks. In our original 2022 paper, we were using a single Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPU to train our network. A hardware guide can be found [here](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/).

:::tip
VAME can also be trained in Google Colab or on a HPC cluster.
:::

Once you have your computing setup ready, begin using VAME by following the [step-by-step guide](/docs/getting_started/step_by_step).
